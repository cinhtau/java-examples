# Arrays

Arrays in Java are treated as Objects! Because an array is an object, its name
is a reference to an array, it's not the array itself.

The array is stored at an address elsewhere in memory,
and the name holds only this address.

## Pros
- quick insertion
- very fast access if index known

## Cons
- slow search
- slow deletion
- fixed size
